Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m applying for the Data Scientist (Insurance AI) role at InsureTech. My background aligns with the role’s requirements, particularly in aws, docker, fastapi.

In recent work, I’ve delivered measurable outcomes by building production-ready systems, improving reliability, and collaborating across teams. I focus on clear problem framing, strong engineering discipline, and evidence-backed results.

I’d welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can help your team deliver impact. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Ganesh Prasad Bhandari
